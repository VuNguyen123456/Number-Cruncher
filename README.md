# Number-Cruncher
Description:
The NumberCruncherUtilities class provides a collection of mathematical and numerical utility methods for analyzing numbers, processing arrays, and performing computations.

Key Features:

Prime Number Check (isPrime) - Determines whether a given number is a prime number.
Coprime Check (isCoprime) - Checks if two numbers are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).
Fibonacci Prime Check (isFibonacciPrime) - Verifies whether a number is both a Fibonacci number and a prime.
Collatz Sequence Counter (countCollatzSteps) - Calculates the number of steps required for a number to reach 1 in the Collatz sequence.
Prime Sieve (sieveOfEratosthenes) - Implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark prime numbers in a boolean array.
Array Replacement (replaceItem) - Replaces occurrences of a specified item in a 2D array with elements from a replacement array.
Usage:
This utility class is suitable for mathematical computations, data processing tasks, and algorithm testing. It can be extended or integrated into larger applications that require numerical or array transformations.

Example Applications:

Prime number identification for cryptography or data analysis.
Fibonacci and Collatz sequence computations for algorithm studies.
Dynamic array manipulation for replacing patterns in datasets.
Note:
The main method includes test cases for the implemented methods, demonstrating their usage and output. Additional test cases can be added as needed.
